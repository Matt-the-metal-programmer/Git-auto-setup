# Git-auto-setup
Hello all!
This is tailored towards linux at the momennt, and still needs a lot of work, but this is a start. 
Just drop the script in your folder with your program. It will create a readme and will also copy a folder with a .gitignore in it.  
You will have to mannually pull out the .gitignore and add it to your git repo as of right now, but ill work on it 
in the future.
